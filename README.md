### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adam. 

I'm working at Boulder as a software developer.

I'm very curious about coding and spend a lot of my time building applications and learning new things. Many of my current projects are business-related projects and therefore private, but I have a few public projects as well.
