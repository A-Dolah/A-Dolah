### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adam. 

I'm working at School of Applied Technology as a Software Development Instructor.

Prior to working with software development I worked as a lawyer (mainly business law) for about four years. Although I still very much enjoy law, I decided to switch careers and become a professional software developer. 

I'm very curious about coding and spend a lot of my time building applications and improving as a programmer. Many of my current projects are business projects and hence the code is private, but I have a few public projects as well. 

ðŸ”­ One project Iâ€™m currently working on is an e-commerce store built with React (through Next.js), Styled Components, Apollo, Express, GraphQL, Prisma and PostgreSQL.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript and Apollo.
